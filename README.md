# KleiCreator
KleiCreator is GUI tools written in Java to assist creating mods for Don't Starve Together.

### Download/Install
In the [Releases](https://lab.deepcore.dev/decduck3/kleicreator/-/releases) there are links to .jar files, which are pre-compiled version of the software. Download and run with at least Java 17. Currently, no installers.

### Progress
Currently, KleiCreator is non-functional. It's missing some key functionality for it to be truly useful, but in it's current state, it can com.deepcore.kleicreator.export mod info, com.deepcore.kleicreator.recipes, com.deepcore.kleicreator.speech and the basics of com.deepcore.kleicreator.items. It currently lacks any components for these com.deepcore.kleicreator.items (eg edible or armor) and any support for characters.
