 2. Master branch: This is a semi-official release. It's built automatically and most likely doesn't have any horrible bugs. You can download it by going [here](https://lab.deepcore.dev/kleicreator/kleicreator/-/pipelines/?scope=branches&page=1) and then click on the dots next to the entry that says "master" (the bottom one).
 3. Development branch: This is a working branch. Except unstable versions, breaking changes, things that can corrupt work. However, this is the most current version. You can download it by going [here](https://lab.deepcore.dev/kleicreator/kleicreator/-/pipelines/?scope=branches&page=1) and then click on the dots next to the entry that says "development" (the top one).
