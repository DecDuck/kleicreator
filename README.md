# KleiCreator
KleiCreator is a GUI tool for creating mods for the games made by Klei Entertainment. It uses a the Java Runtime Environment and cross-platform libraries to enable mods to be made on any platform.  

## About
KleiCreator runs in the JVM (Java virtual machine), and maintains cross-platform compatibility. Additionally, it supports plugins, allowing anyone to extend its functionality without needing to modify and distribute their own version of KleiCreator.

## Plugins
As with a lot of Java applications, plugins are compiled and packaged as `.jar` files. Currently, there is no official documentation for the process of creating plugins, but it can be reverse-engineered by looking through the source code of the SDK. Documentation, however, is on the way.

## Using
KleiCreator can be downloaded from any release, usually called `app-X.X.X.jar`, with an accompanying SDK. These releases are generally quite stable, and automatically check for updates that are newer than themselves.

## Contributing
KleiCreator is open-source, and as with every OSS project, every contribution counts. If you're contributing by writing code and implementing features, fork this repository, commit your changes, then create a Pull Request to get it merged into the root codebase. If you're contributing through testing, create issues with the problem you've found and hopefully a developer will take a look at them and fix the issue.
